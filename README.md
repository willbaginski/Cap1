### Will Baginski, Capital One SWE Summit Submission
Here is a [link to my webpage](http://baggregate.surge.sh/). I used surge.sh to host it.

#### Background
I am a sophomore at Dartmouth College. I've taken courses on OOP, software implementation & design, and discrete mathematics, but I have no prior web design experience! I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to put this project together my inexperience might show a little.

#### Details
I kept the site as simple as possible. I only used one HTML file (and consequently one CSS file), and also kept all my scripts in a single JS file. I wanted to avoid focusing too much on organization given that I had a lot on my plate already with what I had to learn. 

#### Functionality
On the home page, a user can select one of three categories of news to see 20 results about. Each time they make a new selection, the previous results are replaced with the results of the new request. The articles are shown in a three-column format with a picture, headline, source and date, and description for each article. Clicking the image or headline opens the article in a new tab.

#### Reflection
I had a lot of with this project! Seeing the working version come together felt really good--I find a different sort of satisfaction in self-teaching than I do in school projects. My biggest challenges were successfully requesting newsapi and deciding how to allow users to request news. Before I was supplied a pro newsapi key, I was struggling to successfully use the free version. Because of my inexperience with front end web design, I did not realize that my problem wasn't my own fault! I was very relieved when I got the email with the pro key.

With regard to user requests, I at first wanted to implement a way for users to select multiple categories at the same time through form submission. Ultimately, I moved away from the approach in order to keep my code as simple as possible. Given more time, I would have implemented this approach and a way to sorted the results so that the news on the screen is not segregated by category.
